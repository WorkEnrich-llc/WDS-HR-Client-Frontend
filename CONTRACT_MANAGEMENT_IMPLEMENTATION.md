# Contract Status Management Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive contract status management to the employee contracts tab, including:

- **Terminate** and **Resign** actions for Active contracts
- **Cancel** action for Upcoming contracts  
- **View** action for Terminated and Resigned contracts
- **Edit** action for Upcoming and Active contracts only

## Contract Statuses

### Available Statuses

5. **Terminated** - Contract was terminated (NEW)
6. **Resigned** - Employee resigned (NEW)

### Status-Based Actions

## UI Features

### Dropdown Menu for Active Contracts
Active contracts show a dropdown with "Terminate" and "Resign" options instead of individual buttons to save space and improve UX.

### Status Badges
Each status has a distinct color and icon:
- **Active**: Green with checkmark
- **Upcoming**: Blue with clock
- **Terminated**: Red with X
- **Resigned**: Orange with exit icon
- **Cancelled**: Gray with X
- **Expired**: Gray with X

### Form Validation
All modals include proper form validation:
- Required field validation
- Date validation
- Automatic calculation (resign notice period)

## Data Flow

### Terminate Contract
1. User clicks "Actions" → "Terminate" for Active contract
2. Terminate modal opens with form
3. User fills last day and reason
4. On submit: Contract status changes to "Terminated"
5. Termination data is stored with contract

### Resign Contract
1. User clicks "Actions" → "Resign" for Active contract
2. Resign modal opens with form
3. User fills resign date, notice period, and reason
4. Last day is automatically calculated
5. On submit: Contract status changes to "Resigned"
6. Resignation data is stored with contract

### View Details
1. User clicks "View" for Terminated/Resigned contract
2. Appropriate view modal opens
3. Displays stored termination/resignation details

## Sample Data
The implementation includes sample contracts with all statuses for demonstration:
- Contract 001: Active status
- Contract 002: Upcoming status  
- Contract 003: Terminated status (with termination data)
- Contract 004: Resigned status (with resignation data)

## API Integration
Currently uses mock data for demonstration. In production:
- Remove `addSampleContracts()` method
- Implement actual API calls in:
  - `terminateEmployeeContract()`
  - `resignEmployeeContract()`
  - Update contract interface with backend schema
